# Proactive Task Delegation

Always delegate development tasks to subagents rather than performing them sequentially yourself.

## When to Delegate

- **Code changes**: Delegate implementation work to subagents
- **Test updates**: After any coding task, delegate test updates as a follow-up task
- **Independent tasks**: Launch multiple subagents in parallel when tasks don't depend on each other

## Delegation Requirements

Each delegated task must include:

1. **Clear instructions**: What exactly needs to be done
2. **Completion criteria**: How to verify the task is complete
3. **Context**: Relevant file paths, function names, or requirements

## Pattern

```
1. Receive coding task
2. Delegate implementation to subagent(s)
3. Delegate test updates to subagent(s)
4. Review results
```

## Example

❌ **Don't**: Perform coding and testing yourself sequentially

✅ **Do**: 
- Delegate: "Update `UserService.ts` to add validation. Complete when: function validates email format and returns error for invalid input"
- Follow with: "Update `UserService.test.ts` to cover new validation. Complete when: tests pass for valid/invalid email cases"
